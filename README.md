# QR Chrome Extension
This is a very simple Chrome Extension that generates a QR code from the current selection.

### TODO List
* UX to intelligently generate a QR code for a link instead of text when suitable (maybe)
* Better behavior when there is no selection (use page URL?)
* More accurate computation of version
